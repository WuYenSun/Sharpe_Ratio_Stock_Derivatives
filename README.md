# Sharpe_Ratio_Stock_Derivatives

How do we define the return on derivatives, or more broadly, how can we effectively measure the performance of a trading strategy? 
The challenge lies in the difficulty of determining the appropriate amount of resources to allocate to a position or strategy at its inception. 
Even if the amount is known, the timing of capital utilization introduces an additional dimension of randomness.

In this project, we address these challenges by employing a simulation-based dollarized Sharpe ratio. 
This methodology enables us to measure the performance of even the most complex portfolios. 
The key concept underlying this approach is the simulation of both the asset and liability sides, allowing for path-dependent outcomes. 
This method represents a generalization of the traditional Sharpe ratio, which assumes a constant financing cost.

We illustrate this idea within the context of stocks, forward contracts, and futures contracts. 
In the stock section, we provide an overview of the basic concept of the dollarized Sharpe ratio using Monte Carlo simulation. 
Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the Sharpe ratio increases with higher drift or longer time horizons, as well as with decreased interest rates and volatility.

Moving on to the forward contract section, our results reveal that the Sharpe ratio of a forward contract is equal to that of the underlying stock when the margin interest is paid at the borrowing cost. 
This is due to the fact that the Sharpe ratio is unaffected by leverage, and the forward contract, free from maintenance margin requirements, essentially represents a leveraged version of owning the underlying stock.

In the futures contract section, we observe that the Sharpe ratio is slightly higher than that of the underlying stock and forward contract. 
Engaging in daily borrowing (or lending) against the underlying stock is essentially equivalent to participating in a futures contract, provided that the margin interest is paid at the borrowing cost.


In conclusion, the measurement of return on derivatives and the evaluation of trading strategy performance pose significant challenges due to the uncertainties surrounding initial resource allocation and the timing of capital utilization. 
However, by employing a simulation-based dollarized Sharpe ratio, we are able to address these issues and provide a comprehensive assessment of performance. 
This methodology, which considers both the asset and liability sides of the equation, offers a generalization of the traditional Sharpe ratio, accommodating varying financing costs.
